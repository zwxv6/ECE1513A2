# ECE1513A2 
In this assignment, you will be implementing a feed-forward neural network (NN) that will perform classification on the IRIS dataset. The NN will be trained via the stochastic gradient method (SGD), forward propagation and back propagation algorithms. The performance of your implementation will be compared with that of the built-in NN module available in scikit-learn. You will also be asked to answer several questions related to your implementations. For this assignment, we recommend you to attempt the scikit-learn part first. To avoid any potential installation issue, you are encouraged to develop your solution using Google Colab notebooks.
